Art Garfunkel -- Bright Eyes Is it a kind of dream Floating out on the tide Following the river of death downstream Oh, is it a dream? 
There's a fog along the horizon A strange glow in the sky And nobody seems to know where you go And what does it mean Oh, is it a dream? 
Bright eyes, burning like fire Bright eyes, how can you close and fail? 
How can the light that burned so brightly Suddenly burn so pale? 
Bright eyes Is it a kind of shadow Reaching into the night Wandering over the hills unseen Or is it a dream? 
There's a high wind in the trees A cold sound in the air And nobody ever knows when you go And where do you start Oh, into the dark Bright eyes, burning like fire Bright eyes, how can you close and fail? 
How can the light that burned so brightly Suddenly burn so pale? 
Bright eyes Bright eyes, burning like fire Bright eyes, how can you close and fail? 
How can the light that burned so brightly Suddenly burn so pale?

Barbra Streisand -- Woman In Love Life is a moment in space When the dream is gone It's a lonelier place I kiss the morning goodbye But down inside You know we never know why The road is narrow and long When eyes meet eyes And the feeling is strong I turn away from the wall I stumble and fall But I give you it all I am a woman in love And I'll do anything To get you into my world And hold you within It's a right I'll defend Over and over again What do I do? 
With you eternally mine In love there is No measure of time We planned it all at the start That you and I Live in each other's hearts We may be oceans away You feel my love I hear what you say No truth is ever a lie I stumble and fall But I give you it all I am a woman in love And I'll do anything To get you into my world And hold you within It's a right I'll defend Over and over again What do I do?

I met a hula mistress somewhere in Waikiki, Well, she was selling pineapple, playing ukulele, And when I went to the girl, "Come on and teach me to sway," She laughed and whispered to me, "Yes, come tonight to the bay." 
The lovely beach, in the sky the moon of Kauai, Around calypso sarong we'll all be singing this song. 
Agadoo-doo-doo, push pineapple, shake the tree, Agadoo-doo-doo, push pineapple, grind coffee, To the left, to the right, jump up and down and to the knees, Come and dance every night, sing with the hula melody.

The Saturday night city beat had already started The pulse of the corner boys sprang into action And young Billy watched it all under the yellow street light And said "tonight of all nights there's gonna be a fight" He doesn't like it living here in this town He says the traps have been sprung long before he was born He says "hope bites the dust behind all the closed doors And pus and grime ooze from its scab crusted sores. 
There's screaming and crying in the high rise blocks" It's a rat trap Billy and you're already caught But you can make it if you want to or you need it bad enough You're young and good looking and you're acting kind of tough Anyway it's Saturday night time to see what's going down. 
Put on the bright suit Billy, head for the right side of town It's only 8 o'clock but you're already bored You don't know what it is but there's got to be more You'd better find a way out, hey kick down the door It's a rat trap and you've been caught In this town Billy says "everybody tries to tell you what to do" In this town Billy says "everybody says you gotta follow rules." 
Hey you walk up to those traffic lights, Switch from your left to right You push in that button, and when that button comes alight It tells you "Walk don't walk Talk don't talk" Hey Billy take a walk...with me. 
Little Judy's trying to watch "top of the pops" But mum and dad are fighting don't they ever stop, She take down her coat and walks out on the street, It's cold on that road, but it's got that home beat, Deep down in her pockets she finds 50p., Now is that any way for a young girl to be, "I'm gonna get out of school work in some factory, Work all the hours God gave me get myself a little easy money" Now, now, now na na. 
Her mind's made up, she walks down the road, Her hands in her pockets, coat buttoned 'gainst the cold, She finds Billy down at the Italion cafe And when he's drunk it's hard to understand what Billy says But then he mumbles in his coffee and suddenly roars, "It's a rat trap and we've been caught...."

And do you have faith in God above? 
If the Bible tells you so Now, do you believe in rock and roll? 
Can music save your mortal soul? 
And can you teach me how to dance real slow? 
Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' "This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die" Now for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lenin read a book on Marx A quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' "This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die" Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the halftime air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance 'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? 
We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' "This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die" Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil's only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in Hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' "This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die" I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets, the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin' "This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die" They were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye And singin' "This'll be the day that I die" Donna Summer -- I Feel Love Ooh It's so good, it's so good, it's so good, it's so good, it's so good Ooh Heaven knows, heaven knows, heaven knows, heaven knows, heaven knows Ooh I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love I feel love I feel love Ooh Fallin' free, fallin' free, fallin' free, fallin' free, fallin' free Ooh You and me, you and me, you and me, you and me, you and me Ooh I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love I feel love I feel love I feel love I feel love Ooh I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you Ooh What you do, what you do, what you do, what you do, what you do Ooh I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love, I feel love I feel love I feel love I feel love I feel love I feel love Donny Osmond -- Puppy Love And they called it puppy love Oh I guess they'll never know How a young heart really feels And why I love her so And they called it puppy love Just because we're in our teens Tell them all, please tell them it isn't fair To take away my only dream I cry each night my tears for you My tears are all in vain I hope and I pray that maybe someday You'll be back  in my arms Once again Someone help me, help me, help me please Is the answer up above?

Man, how's your daughter? 
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her? 
I'mma name her Bonnie I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry. 
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat! 
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I Got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew That's my little brother man, he's only six years old We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, "No" That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way I never knew my father neither He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her I can relate to what you're saying in your songs So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on 'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you twenty-four/seven But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no-one does She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose Sincerely yours, Stan P.S. 
We should be together, too My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I Got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad Dear Mr. 
I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans: This'll be the last package I ever send your ass! 
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it? 
I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? 
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air Tonight"? 
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning? 
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? 
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me See Slim; shut up bitch! 
I'm tryin' to talk! 
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you 'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now - Oh, shit! 
I forgot! 
How am I supposed to send this shit out? 
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I Got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? 
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? 
I say that shit just clownin' dogg; c'mon, how fucked up is you? 
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? 
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other! 
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan Why are you so mad? 
Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to Come to think of it, his name was... 
it was you! 
Damn...

Now Joseph and his wife Mary Come to Bethlehem that night And find no place to borne she child Not a single room was in sight. 
Hark, now hear the angels sing A new King born today And man will live forever more Because of Christmas day. 
By and by they find a little nook In a stable all forlorn And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born. 
Hark, now hear the angels sing A new King born today And man will live forever more Because of Christmas day.

Karen Young -- Nobody's Child I was slowly passing an orphan's home one day. 
And stopped there for a moment just to watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing and when I asked him why he turned with eyes that could not see and he began to cry. 
People come for children and take them for their own. 
But they all seem to pass me by and I am left alone. 
I know they'd like to take me but when they see I'm blind they always take some other child and I am left behind. 
(No) mother's arms to hold me or soothe me when I cry. 
Sometimes it gets so lonely I wish that I could die. 
I'd walk the streets of heaven where all the blind can see. 
And just like all the other kids there'd be a home for me. 
I'm nobody's child I'm nobody's child I'm like a flower just growing wild. 
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smile nobody wants me I'm nobody's child.

Kenny Rogers -- Coward Of The County Evryone considered him the coward of the county He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong His mama named him Tommy; the folks just called him 'Yellow' But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy "Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun" "Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done Walk away from trouble if you can It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek I hope you're old enough to understand Son, you dont have to fight to be a man" There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky In her arms, he didn't have to prove he was a man One day, while he was workin', the Gatlin boys came callin' They took turns at Becky; there was three of them Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin' The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again: "Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done Walk away from trouble if you can It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek I hope you're old enough to understand Son, you dont have to fight to be a man" The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor When Tommy turned around they said, "Hey look! 
Ol' yellow's leavin'" But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him He wasn't holdin nothin' back; he let 'em have it all When Tommy left the barroom, not a Gatlin boy was standin' He said, "This one's for Becky," as he watched the last one fall And I heard him say "I promised you, dad, not to do the things you done I walk away from trouble when I can Now please dont think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek And papa, I sure hope you understand Sometimes you gotta fight when youre a man" Everyone considered him the coward of the county Kings Of Leon -- Sex On Fire Lay where you're layin', don't make a sound I know they're watchin', they're watchin' All the commotion, the kiddie-like play Has people talkin', talkin' You, your sex is on fire The dark of the alley, the breakin' of day Head while I'm drivin', I'm drivin' Soft lips are open, your knuckles are pale Feels like you're dyin', you're dyin' You, your sex is on fire Consumed with what's to transpire Hot as a fever, rattlin' bones I could just taste it, taste it If it's not forever, if it's just tonight Oh, we're still the greatest, the greatest, the greatest You, your sex is on fire And you, your sex is on fire Consumed with what's to transpire And you, your sex is on fire Consumed with what's to transpire KWS -- Please Don't Go Please don't go....

Leapy Lee -- Little Arrows There's a boy a little boy Shooting arrows in the blue And he's aiming them at someone But the question is at who. 
Is it me or is it you It's hard to tell until you're hit But you know it when they hit you 'Cause they hurt a little bit. 
Here they come pouring out of the blue Little arrows for me and for you You're falling in love again Falling in love again. 
Little arrows in your clothing Little arrows in your hair When you're in love you'll find Those little arrows everywhere Little arrows that will hit you once And hit you once again Little arrows that hit everybody Every now and then. 
Oh oh oh the pain. 
Some folks run and others hide But ain't nothing they can do And some folks put on armor But the arrows go straight through. 
So you see there's no escape So why not face it and admit That you love those little arrows When they hurt a little bit. 
Here they come pouring out of the blue.

Where women glow and men plunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? 
You better run, you better take cover" Buying bread from a man in Brussels He was six foot four and full of muscles I said, "Do you speak-a my language?" 
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich And he said: "I come from a land down under Where beer does flow and men chunder Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? 
You better run, you better take cover" Lying in a den in Bombay With a slack jaw and not much to say I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me? 
Because I come from the land of plenty" And he said: "Oh! 
Do you come from a land down under?

Standing at the edge, of my ordinary life. 
Now i'm looking far ahead, I only see clear blue skies. 
I hope this feeling lasts me, until the end of time. 
Now I don't see the things that bring me down like I used to noooo And there were times we felt like giving up but we came through... 
...All this time, we've gone a long-a-long away. 
I've waited a lifetime for today, I'm praying this moments here to stay All this time, When everyone else said I was wrong, You gave me a reason to be strong, You gave me the will to carry on, All this time. 
I kissed my moods away, and yesterdays far behind, And all these clouds have died, I cleared out all my mind. 
Now i'm looking far ahead, I'm looking with brand new eyes, Well I can see the future, I know its looking bright. 
Never thought we could survive but we've come through noooo And there were times we felt like giving up but we came through... 
...All this time, we've gone a long-a-long away. 
I've waited a lifetime for today, I'm praying this moments here to stay All this time, When everyone else said I was wrong, You gave me a reason to be strong, You gave me the will to carry on, All this time It's like a second chance in life, so many people pass it by, and you know it's a shame 'coz they can't believe so they don't and they wont even try, but every battle that's been won, but every little thing i've done, and i couldn't see it's not for me to mean...

my car When I put the clutch down The Halloween hop when everyone came In funny disguises Magic moments Filled with love Pet Shop Boys -- It's A Sin When I look back upon my life It's always with a

cards Would not let her be One of sixteen vestal virgins Who were leaving for the coast And although my eyes were open They might just as well have been closed And so it was that later As the miller

can hear the country song from far, And someone plays the honky tonky guitar, Where all the lights will go on one by one, People enjoying the sun, And the wind takes it  away, Where the Mississippi rolls down to the sea, And lovers found the place they like to be, How many times before this song was ending, Love and understanding everywhere around. 
Mississippi, I'll remember you, Whenever I shall go away, I'll be longing for the day, When I will be in Greensville again, Mississippi you'llbe on my  mind, Everytime I hear this song, Mississippi rolls along until the end of time. 
Now the country song forever lost it's soul, When the guitar player turns to rock'n'roll, And everytime when summer nights are falling, I always will be calling, Dreams of yesterday. 
Mississippi, I'll remember you, Whenever I shall go away, I'll be longing for the day, When I will be in Greensville again, Mississippi you'll be on my mind, Everytime I hear this song, Mississippi rolls along until the end of time. 
Everytime I hear this song, Mississippi rolls along until the end of time.

The days were endless We were crazy, we were young The sun was always shining, we just lived for fun Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know The rest of my life's been just a show Those were the days of our lives The bad things in life were so few Those days are all gone now But one thing is true When I look and I find I still love you You can't turn back the clock You can't turn back the tide, ain't that a shame? 
Ooh, I'd like to go back one time on a rollercoaster ride When life was just a game No use in sitting And thinking on what you did When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know Better sit back and go with the flow 'Cause these are the days of our lives They've flown in the swiftness of time These days are all gone now But some things remain When I look and I find no change Those were the days of our lives, yeah The bad things in life were so few Those days are all gone now But one thing's still true When I look and I find I still

Roger Whittaker -- The Last Farewell There's a ship lies rigged and ready in the harbor Tomorrow for old England she sails Far away from your land of endless sunshine To my land full of rainy skies and gales And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell For you are beautiful And I have loved you dearly More dearly than the spoken word can tell For you are beautiful And I have loved you dearly More dearly than the spoken word can tell I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing And the taste of war I know so very well Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising Their guns on fire as we sail into hell I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow But how bitter will be this last farewell For you are beautiful And I have loved you dearly More dearly than the spoken word can tell For you are beautiful And I have loved you dearly More dearly than the spoken word can tell Though death and darkness gather all about me And my ship be torn apart upon the sea I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands In the heaving waves that brought me once to thee And should I return safe home again to England I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale For you are beautiful And I have loved you dearly More dearly than the spoken word can tell For you are beautiful And I have loved you dearly More dearly than the spoken word can tell Rosemary Clooney -- This Ole House This ole house once knew his children This ole house once knew his wife This ole house was home and comfort As they fought the storms of life This old house once rang with laughter This old house heard many shouts Now he trembles in the darkness When the lightnin' walks about Ain't got time to fix the shingles Ain't got time to fix the floor Ain't got time to oil the hinges Nor to mend the windowpane Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer He's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints This ole house is a-gettin' shaky This ole house is a-gettin' old This ole house lets in the rain This ole house lets in the cold On his knees are a-gettin' chilly But he feel no fear nor pain 'Cause he see an angel peekin' Through a broken windowpane Ain't got time to fix the shingles Ain't got time to fix the floor Ain't got time to oil the hinges Nor to mend the windowpane Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer He's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints This ole house is afraid of thunder This ole house is afraid of storms This ole house just groans and trembles When the night wind flings its arms This ole house is gettin' feeble This old house is needin' paint Just like him it's tuckered out But he's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints Ain't got time to fix the shingles Ain't got time to fix the floor Ain't got time to oil the hinges Nor to mend the windowpane Ain't a-gonna need this house no longer He's a-gettin' ready to meet the saints Roxy Music -- Dance Away Yesterday, when it seemed so cool, When I walked you home, kiss goodnight, I said "it's love", you said "alright". 
Its funny how, I could never cry, Until tonight, when you pass by, Hand-in-Hand with another guy, You're dressed to kill, and guess whos dying... 
Dance away the heartache, Dance away, tears. 
Dance away the heartache, Dance away, fears. 
Dance away... 
Loneliness, is a crowded room, Full of open hearts, turned to stone. 
All together, all alone. 
All at once, my whole world had changed. 
Now I'm in the dark, off the wall, Lit the strobe light up the wall. 
I close my eyes, and dance til dawn. 
Dance away the heartache, Dance away, tears. 
Dance away the heartache, Dance away, fears. 
Dance away... 
Dance away... 
Dance away... 
Now I know, I must walk the line Until i find an open door, Off the street or onto the floor. 
There was I, many times a fool, I hoped and prayed, but not too much, Out of reach is out of touch, All the way is far enough. 
Dance away the heartache, Dance away, tears. 
Dance away the heartache, Dance away, fears. 
Dance away the heartache, Dance away, tears. 
Dance away the heartache, Dance away, fears. 
Roy Orbison -- In Dreams A candy-colored clown they call the sandman Tiptoes to my room every night Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper "Go to sleep, everything is alright" I close my eyes, then I drift away Into the magic night, I softly say A silent prayer like dreamers do Then I fall asleep to dream my dreams of you In dreams I walk with you In dreams I talk to you In dreams you're mine all the time We're together in dreams, in dreams But just before the dawn I awake and find you gone I can't help it, I can't help it if I cry I remember that you said goodbye Too bad it only seems It only happens in my dreams Only in dreams In beautiful dreams Roy Orbison -- It's Over Your baby doesn't love you anymore Golden days before they end Whisper secrets to the wind Your baby won't be near you any more Tender nights before they fly Send falling stars that seem to cry Your baby doesn't want you anymore It's over It breaks your heart in two, to know she's been untrue But oh what will you do? 
Then she said to you There's someone new, we're through, we're through It's over, it's over, it's over All the rainbows in the sky Start to weep, then say goodbye You won't be seeing rainbows any more Setting suns before they fall, echo to you that's all, that's all But you'll see lonely sunset after all It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over Roy Orbison -- Oh Pretty Woman Pretty woman, walking down the street Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet Pretty woman I don't believe you, you're not the truth No one could look as good as you Mercy Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?

In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air I was born too late into a world that doesn't care Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair When the head of state didn't play guitar Not everybody drove a car When music really mattered and when radio was king When accountants didn't have control And the media couldn't buy your soul And computers were still scary and we didn't know everything Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air I was born too late into a world that doesn't care Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair When pop stars still remained a myth And ignorance could still be bliss And when God Save the Queen she turned a whiter shade of pale When my mom and dad were in their teens And anarchy was still a dream And the only way to stay in touch was a letter in the mail Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair In '77 and '69, revolution was in the air I was born too late into a world that doesn't care Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair When record shops were still on top And vinyl was all that they stocked And the super info-highway was still drifting out in space Kids were wearing hand-me-downs And playing games meant kick arounds And footballers still had long hair and dirt across their face Oh, I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in

Tomorrow will you be gone?

This used to be the life but I don't need another one You like cuttin' up and carrying on, you wear them gowns So how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down? 
So I play along when I hear that special song I'm gonna be the one who gets it right You better move when you're swingin' round the room Looks like magic's solely ours tonight But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today Don't feel like dancin', dancin' Even if I find nothin' better to do Don't feel like dancin', dancin' Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood? 
Don't feel like dancin', dancin' Rather be home with the one in the bed till dawn with you Cities come and cities go just like the old empires When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile You got so many colors, make a blind man so confused Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

Bart. 
Bart. 
*smash* BART! 
Bart: I didn't do it. 
Nobody saw me do it. 
You can't prove anything. 
Bart: Yo! 
Hey, what's happening, dude? 
I'm the guy with the rep for being rude. 
Terrorizing people wherever I go, It's not intentional, just keepin' the flow. 
Fixin' test scores to get the best scores. 
Droppin' banana peels all over the floor. 
I'm the kid that made delinquency an art; Last name Simpson, first name Bart. 
I'm here today to introduce the next phase, The next step in the big Bart craze. 
I've got a dance real easy to do; I learned it with no rhythm, and so can you. 
So move your body if you've got the notion, Front to back in a rock-like motion. 
Now that you've got it, if you think you can, Do it to the music -- that's the Bartman. 
Back: Everybody, if you can, do the Bartman. 
Bart: Whoa! 
Back: Shake your body, turn it out if you can, man. 
Bart: Shake it out, man! 
Back: Front to the back, to the side if you can, can.

Bart: It wasn't long ago, just a couple of weeks, I got in trouble, yeah, pretty deep. 
Homer was yellin', Homer: BART! 
Bart: Mom was too, Because I put mothballs in the beef stew. 
Punishment time, in the air lurks gloom, Sitting by myself, confined to my room. 
When all else fails, nothin' else left to do, I turn on the music, so I can feel the groove. 
Back: Move your body, if you've got the notion. 
Bart: Whoa, I'm feelin' the groove now, baby!

My love, if we should break up, Should we ever part, And you're searching for some memory To help your aching heart, Forget about the hurtful things That lovers often say, And remember this perfect day, Then pe ople started coming around the fire, And I was strumming at my old guitar Trying to think of something everybody knew, And then you said "though it's far away, A Christmas song would really make my day," And everyone sang... 
And all I really want to do' Is sing songs for you, Then it's been a perfect day, Yes it's been a perfect day.

The next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. 
A sergeant commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer, the text was taken up next. 
Those of the boys who had a prayer book took them out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread them out. 
The Sergeant saw the cards and said, "Soldier, put away those cards." 
After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and brought before the Provost Marshall. 
The Marshall said, "Sergeant, why have you brought this man here?" 
"For playing cards in church, Sir." 
"And what have you to say for yourself, son?" 
"Much, Sir," replied the soldier. 
The Marshall said, "I hope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever punished." 
The soldier said, "Sir, I have been on the march for about six days. 
I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy you, Sir, with the purity of my intentions." 
And with that, the boy started his story: "You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there is but one God. 
And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into two parts, the Old and the New Testaments. 
When I see the Trey, I think of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. 
And when I see the Four, I think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. 
And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. 
When I see the Six, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and earth. 
When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God rested from His great work. 
And when I see the Eight, I think of the eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. 
And when I see the Nine, I think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn't even thank Him. 
When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God handed down to Moses on a table of stone. 
When I see the King, it reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. 
And when I see the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of Heaven. 
And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. 
When I count the number of spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year. 
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. 
There are 4 suits, the number of weeks in a month. 
There are 12 picture cards, the number of months in a year. 
There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter. 
So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a Prayer Book." 
"And friends, the story is true. 
I know, I was that soldier."
